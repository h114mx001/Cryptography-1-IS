    "The critical in this script is the wrong implementation in the function `xor_flag_with_otp()`, let's analyze the function.\n",

So we can 'safely' remove the chance of having an attack on the PRG. (Which we will demonstrate in another attack). \n",

    "First, let's see, why the ciphertext could leak some bytes from the plaintext? The function `os.urandom(n)` will give us a random bytestring with a given length $n$. Each byte has the value in range $[0, 255]$ in decimal. If `urandom` gives a byte `0` in the OTP, it could 'leak' the byte from the plaintext, as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can do some eliminations based on the ciphertext we request. For example, if $p_i = 32$, this implies that $c_i \\in [0, 255] \\setminus \\{32\\}$. We will request many ciphertexts, and if we have seen all value in the set $[0, 255] \\setminus \\{32\\}$, we can say that $p_i = 32$."
